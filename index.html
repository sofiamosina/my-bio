        <h2>KAZAN, RUSSIA</h2>
        <p>
          This is the city where I lived most of my life. I graduated from high
          school in Kazan and moved to Canada when I was 17 years old. My flight
          to Canada was actually on the same night as the prom night, but I
          managed to catch both!

        <h2>BRIGHTON, UK</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>When I was 14 years old</strong>, I participated in an English
          language contest in my hometown. The prize was a 2-month trip to
          Brighton, UK, and I won it. It was my first solo trip to another
          country, and since then I decided that I would not go to university in
          Russia.

        <h2>SOFIA, BULGARIA</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since my trip to Brighton, I was looking for colleges and
          universities abroad. I found a great university in Bulgaria, which is
          a country not far from Russia, and I made up my mind to get enrolled.
          I went there to take my SAT preparation course, but I changed my mind
          and applied to Canadian colleges instead, for a number of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Possibility of getting PR after graduating</li>
          <li>Life quality and security</li>
          <li>Cultural experience and diversity</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="city-desc">
        <h2>TORONTO, CANADA</h2>
        <p>
          I moved here when I was 17, and I graduated from the GBC hospitality
          program with honours. After that, I worked as a Reception Supervisor
          and got my PR. Now I am back to school again to see where it takes me
          next!
